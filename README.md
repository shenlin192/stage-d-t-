There are four different projects in this repo, namely ***yikaimobile***, ***yikaiweb***, ***advanceyikaiweb*** and ***professionalyikaiweb***.

The main files of these projects are contained in their ***"templates"*** folder respectively. For example "index2.html" or "index3.html" in project "yikaimobile". Even thought these main files are in the form of .html, but if you look at them carefully, you will find all the Javascript logics contained in "script" tags.  

Folders like ***"images" "audios" "styles" "Js"*** cantain different kinds of resources for their project.

Folders like ***"admin" "data" "includes" "modules" "temp"*** are some php configurations which are used to set up the basic developping envirnment.
